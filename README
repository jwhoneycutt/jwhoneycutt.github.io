Attempting to use my (20 MB) master TW5.html file as a static website generator

Tiddlers tagged "Public" are filtered and exported as an HTML file to:

file:///Users/jwh/jwhPublicWiki/tiddlers/tiddlers.html (1.3 MB)

Now, how do I get index.html (in personal GitHub repository) to point to: 

file:///Users/jwh/jwhPublicWiki/tiddlywiki.info
